# MyReads Project

This WAS the starter template for the first project for Udacity's React Nano Degree course. Using the static HTML template provided, code was written to navigate a library of books that can be sorted onto shelves depending on whether the user is Currently Reading, Wants to Read, or has Read them.

This project focuses on state management across parent and child components as well as React Router to navigate between two views, the App root and Search views.

## Install
